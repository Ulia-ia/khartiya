Build and install instructions
==============================

You need fontforge (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/), xgridfit
(http://xgridfit.sourceforge.net/) and font-helpers
(http://code.google.com/p/font-helpers/ ) in order to build the fonts from
the sources. Also you should have GNU make and coreutils. At first you
must unpack/copy files from font-helpers into the directory where *.sfd
files are located. Then type

make

and the truetype fonts will be produced. On systems with X.Org you may do

make install

as root to install the fonts system-wide (/usr/share/fonts/TTF). Otherwise
copy *.ttf files into the ~/.fonts/ directory. Then run "fc-cache" if you have
fontconfig.

The sources and the compiled fonts are available at
http://code.google.com/p/khartiya/
Tarballs are compressed with xz (http://tukaani.org/xz/).
