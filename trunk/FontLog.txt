These fonts are based on Bitstream Charter font which was released by Bitstream for X
Window System with following license:

Build and install instructions
==============================

You need fontforge (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/), xgridfit
(http://xgridfit.sourceforge.net/) and font-helpers
(http://code.google.com/p/font-helpers/ ) in order to build fonts from
the sources. Also you should have GNU make and coreutils. At first you
must unpack/copy files from font-helpers into the directory where *.sfd
files are located. Then type

make

and truetype fonts will be produced. On systems with X.Org you may do

make install

as root to install fonts system-wide (/usr/share/fonts/TTF). Otherwise
copy *.ttf files into ~/.fonts/ directory. Then run fc-cache if you have
fontconfig.
